The cloth face coverings recommended to slow spread of #COVID19 are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators.  Those critical supplies must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure to help slow the spread of #COVID19.
Maintaining 6-feet min. social distancing remains important to slowing spread of #COVID19.  CDC also advises use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.
In light of new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings to slow spread of #COVID19 in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores &amp; pharmacies) esp. in areas of significant community-based transmission.
Recent studies show that a significant portion of individuals with #COVID19 lack symptoms (‚Äúasymptomatic‚Äù) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (‚Äúpre-symptomatic‚Äù) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms.

@MelMal422 Between 1971 and 1989, children routinely received one dose of MMR vaccine. The recommendation changed to 2 doses after some disease outbreaks in the 1980s. If you plan to travel internationally or live in an outbreak area, check with your doctor to see if you need a 2nd dose.

Seeing your child uncomfortable isn‚Äôt fun but remember that vaccine side effects usually last only a couple of days. 

The long-term protection you give your little one with #vaccines outweighs any possible short-term side effects. #ivax2protect https://t.co/VutEPxltLO
While little ones may experience mild side effects from #vaccines, serious reactions are very rare. 

However, if you notice anything that concerns you, don‚Äôt hesitate to check in with your child‚Äôs doctor. #ivax2protect https://t.co/kPH6JZMFSe
After your baby is vaccinated, use a cool, wet cloth where he got his shots to reduce soreness and redness. If his doctor approves, a non-aspirin pain reliever can also be used to reduce a low-grade fever.

These minor reactions are common and will go away soon. #ivax2protect https://t.co/JTSf2u1Qyv

@entaylor22 Of 24 known measles genotypes, WHO lists 5 genotypes known to currently circulate &amp; are most commonly seen: B3, D4, D8, D9, and H1. MMR vaccine provides long-lasting protection against all strains of measles. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles.
@BenoitLia @WCVB Between 1971 and 1989, children routinely received one dose of MMR vaccine. The recommendation changed to 2 doses after some disease outbreaks in the 1980s. If you plan to travel internationally or live in an outbreak area, check with your doctor to see if you need a 2nd dose.

@simardswellness The routine vaccine recommendation for measles protection has not changed in 30 years.
@simardswellness CDC recommends that infants traveling internationally should receive an early dose of MMR vaccine dose at age 6-11 months. Those babies will also need the recommended 2 doses at 12-15 months and 4-6 yrs to get the best protection.
@simardswellness Maternal antibodies transferred through the placenta give infants some protection from birth through the first months of life. The first dose of MMR vaccine is regularly recommended at age 12-15 months; at that time, the baby‚Äôs immune system can work to build its own immunity.
